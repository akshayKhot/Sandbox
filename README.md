# ASP.NET + Aurelia + TypeScript + Webpack

### Getting Started

1. Clone the Sandbox application.

        $ git clone https://github.com/akshayKhot/Sandbox.git

2. Change to the Sandbox directory and install the npm packages. 

        $ cd Sandbox
        $ npm install

3. Build the client app.

        $ npm start

4. Start the ASP.NET application.

        $ dotnet run

5. Go to `https://localhost:5001`.
6. To watch for changes in the TypeScript files, run the app in watch mode. 
  
        $ npm run watch
        
7. To build the front-end for production, which reduces the bundle size from 3.3 MB to 300 KB, build the app.

        $ npm run build


### What's Aurelia?

[Aurelia](https://aurelia.io/) is an open-source, opinionated, JavaScript framework. It is designed to enable you to easily build powerful web, mobile, or desktop applications. Aurelia uses open web standards. Its no-nonsense, get-out-of-your-way conventions allow you to quickly build powerful applications. [Read](https://docs.aurelia.io/) the documentation to learn more about Aurelia. 

### What's ASP.NET?

[ASP.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet) is a free, cross-platform, and open-source framework that lets you build web apps and services with .NET and C#.

### What's TypeScript?

[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is an open-source programming language developed by Anders Hejlsberg at Microsoft. It acts as a superset of JavaScript and adds typing support to the language. It also provides extensive tooling for the JavaScript ecosystem. 

### What's Sandbox?

Setting up an ASP.NET project that uses Aurelia, along with TypeScript can be a hassle. There's just not enough information online. This project tries to combine these three powerful technologies in a single project that you can set up within two minutes.
